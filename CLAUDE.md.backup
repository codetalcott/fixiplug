I am working in a workspace that has the following structure:
```
package.json
src/
  index.ts
```
This view of the workspace structure may be truncated. You can use tools to collect more context if needed.

Project conventions:
- Style: 2 spaces, double quotes, with semicolons

AI Context Resources:
- cache: .agent-assist/cache.json (cache data)

.agent-assist directory contents:
- cache.json

To access these resources, use file system operations to read these files. For example:
```javascript
const indexData = await fs.readJson(path.join(projectRoot, '.agent-assist', 'index.json'));
const standardsPath = path.join(projectRoot, '.agent-assist', indexData.resources.standards.path);
```

<reminder>
When using the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use a line comment with `...existing code...` to represent regions of unchanged code.
